The loss of biodiversity and the degradation of natural ecosystems pose a significant
threat to the broader economy and financial stability that central banks and financial
supervisors cannot ignore. To gain further insights into the implications of nature and
ecosystem service degradation for financial stability, this study assesses the
dependencies of euro area non-financial corporations and banks on different
ecosystem services. The study then develops a method to capture banks’ credit
portfolio sensitivity to possible future changes in the provision of ecosystem services.
Our results show that 75% of all corporate loan exposures in the euro area have a
strong dependency on at least one ecosystem service. We also find that loan
portfolios may be significantly affected if nature degradation continues its current
trend, with greater vulnerabilities concentrated in certain regions and economic
sectors.
