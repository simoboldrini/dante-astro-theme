Biodiversity – the variety of life on Earth – is essential for sustaining the healthy
ecosystems that our economy and banks depend on. Despite the clear benefits of a
healthy natural world for people and the economy, humanity is putting immense
pressure on nature and biodiversity. Economic activities that rely on healthy nature
are often responsible for generating environmental pressures. It is important to
assess the impact that firms and financial institutions have on nature degradation, in
order to reveal their exposure to transition risk and highlight the need to move
towards an economic system that values nature, rather than putting it at risk. This
study analyses the contribution of euro area economic activities – and the bank
loans provided to enable them – to biodiversity loss by estimating biodiversity
footprints. The datasets we use account for approximately €4.3 trillion in corporate
loans to around 4.2 million companies located in the euro area, issued by more than
2,500 unique consolidated euro area banks. Considering two primary drivers of
biodiversity loss (land-use change and climate change), the results show that the
economy has had a significant impact on biodiversity, equivalent to the loss of 582
million hectares of “pristine” natural areas worldwide. Even though the impact on
biodiversity is highest in Europe, the supply chains of companies are important
determinants of their indirect biodiversity footprint worldwide. Asia and Africa have
the largest areas impacted by activities that take place in company supply chains.
Additionally, financing of economic activities with a high global impact on nature is
concentrated: the ten banks with the highest financing share are responsible for
financing around 40% of the total global impact of euro area firms. To avoid risk
underestimation, this study highlights the importance of considering both climate
change and nature loss when developing risk assessment frameworks, because they
are inextricably intertwined.
